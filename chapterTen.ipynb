    "We spent chapter nine learning about how we can calculate and apply the gradients to adjust weights & biases to ultimately reduce loss. What we ended up doing was subtracting a fraction of the gradient for each weight and bias parameter -- and that is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Most optimizer that we use are actually just modifications in the implementation of SGD.\n",

    "Anyone who's heard about optimizers before has probably heard many names -- seemingly used interchangeably -- including:\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD.\n",
    "- Vanilla Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent or GD, Batch Gradient Descent or BGD.\n",
    "- Mini-batch Gradient Descent or MBGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "However: these are not the same. SGD has historically referred to an optimizer that fits a single sample at a time. Meanwhile, BGD is an optimizer used to fit a whole dataset at once. Lastly, MBGD is an optimizer used to fit slices to a dataset, which we'd call batches in our context.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb, we call slices of data **batches**. However, historically, these same slices have been referred to as **mini-batches** in the context of SGD. With that said, the field has evolved and the two are now used interchangeably to the point where we actually think of the SGD optimizer as one that assumes a batch of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of SGD, we need to choose a learning rate. From that, we then subtract $\\text{learning_rate} \\cdot \\text{paramater_gradients}$ from the actual values. \n",
    "\n",

    "Now making models that are learning and performing better on their dataset -- which we can clearly see by increasing accuracy and decreasing loss. However, our accuracy seems to get stuck just below the ~.70 mark with about ~.62 loss. That tells us the model may have reached a local minimum, which we'll talk about soon. That tells us that adding epochs likely won't be very helpful at this point, and we need to work on our optimizer. The first thing we can change is the learning rate, so that's what we'll look at next!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Learning Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to apply a fraction of the gradients to the parameters in order to descend the loss value. Typically, we don't apply the full gradient value (which would just be the slope of the tangent line) because these values will typically be too large to produce meaningful improvements. Instead, we want to perform small steps, calculating the gradient and updating parameters by a negative fraction of this gradient. These small steps allow us to ensure that we are following the direction of the steepest descent -- but these can be too small, causing learning stagnation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the learning rate is too small, the update to the parameters are too small the model may get stuck in a local minimum as opposed to actually finding the global minimum. So, how do we know if our model is at the global minimum? We know it is so when the loss reaches as close to 0 as possible -- but we frequently never reach 0 in practice, as that may cause overfitting (a topic which I assume will be talked about in a later chapter). \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate in itself is not enough -- you may still be getting stuck in local minimums no matter what you set it to. So, for that reason, we must introduce momentum. Momentum, in an optimizer, adds to the gradient what we, in the physical world, would call intertia. For example, if we throw a ball uphill, then with enough force or a small enough hill, the ball can roll over the crest of the hill and onto the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters in the optimizer (such as the learning rate or momentum) are referred to as hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the learning rate is too big the model may start jumping around during SGD, caused by the amount of gradient applied being too large. At the extreme, this may cause a gradient explosion. A gradient explosion is where the parameter updates cause the function's output to rise instead of fall, causing the gradient and loss to increase with each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, choosing the correct hyperparameters will enable you to speed up the learning process and save yourself money and time. It's typically best to start with the optimizer defaults, perform a few steps, and then observe the training process when tuning different settings. However, it's always useful to have some system that actively tunes your hyperparameters even during training. One way that we do this is by using learning rate decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Learning Rate Decay   \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of learning rate decay is to start with a large learning rate (i.e. something like 1.0) and then decrease it during training. We have a few ways of going about this, and one is to decrease the learning rate in response to the loss across epochs. You can either program this by checking performance or manually adjust it once you deem it appropriate. The other way is to implement a decay rate which steadily decays the learning rate per batch or epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by planning decay per step -- otherwise known as 1/t decaying or exponential decaying. We'll be updating the learning rate each step by the reciprocal step count function, and this will take the step and the decaying ratio and multiples them. Basically, the bigger the step is, the biggest the result of this multiplication. As the take the reciprocal, that means that our learning rate will continue decreasing by ever smaller amounts. The fraction then works out to $\\frac{1}{1 + lr * step}$, with the added 1 on the bottom ensuring that our learning rate decay will never raise the lr. Let's show how this can work in code:"

    "Now we're on the right track, with higher accuracy and the lowest loss so far. However, it is likely still possible to produce a better output, as it seems possible the model has gotten stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 4: SGD with Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum may be a solution to our problem - as it creates a rolling average of gradients over some number of updates and uses this avg. with the unique gradient at each step. This helps when a model gets stuck in a local minimum and is bouncing around in it. As we remember, the gradient as a vector points in the direction of the steepest loss ascent -- meaning the direction which, if followed, would lead to loss **increasing** the most. For that reason, we always take the negative of the gradient, as that logically would point us in the direction of the steepest loss ascent. If you understand linear algebra, I would relate it as follows: imagine you have a gradient in a 2d space as a column vector g, where g=[1,2]. Then, you have a line going up 2 and 1 to the right, and if you follow that line your loss will increase by the highest amount. Now, if we take the negative of that, we have g=[-1,-2], meaning that we have a new vector going 2 to the left, and 1 down -- which is our direction of steepest loss descent. That example really helped me intuitively understand it, so I hope it helped you too. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason momentum is so helpful is thanks to leveraging previous movements. Pure SGD simply goes into the opposite direction of the steepest loss ascent, meaning it is possible for it to bounce between \"walls\" of a local minimum and never be able to get out. Momentum on the other hand uses the previous update's direction to influence the next update's direction, minimizing the odds of such bouncing around.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use momentum by setting a parameter between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of the previous parameter update to retain, and subtracting our actual gradient, multiplied by the learning rate. The update then contains only a portion of the gradient from preceding steps as our momentum and only a portion of the current gradient. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we set the momentum value too high, the model might stop learning at all since the direction of updates may not be able to follow the global gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this is as follows: ```weight_updates = self.momentum * layer.weight_momentums - self.lr_curr * layer.dweights``` where the hyperparameter self.momentum is chosen at the start and the layer.weight_momentums start as all zeros but as changed during training as ```layer.weight_momentums = weight_updates```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above tells us that momentum is always updated before the parameters -- so we'll add it to our updateParams() method in the SGD class. I'll show the additions here and also make changes directly in the classes.py. "

This has the advantage of normalizing the updates made to features -- preventing certain weights from rising disproportionally to others. AdaGrad keeps a history of previous updates and, the bigger the sum of the updates is (both pos. or neg.), then the smaller updates are made further in training. This has the benefit of allowing less-frequently updated parameters to keep-up with changes, resulting in a more effective use of neurons for training.\n",

    "This concept can be contained in the following two lines of code: ```cache += parm_gradient ** 2 ``` and ```parm_updates = lr * parm_gradient / (sqrt(cache) + eps)```. In this, the cache holds a history of squared gradients, and the parm_updates is a function of the learning rate multipled by the gradient and is then divided by the sqrt of the cache plus an epsilon value. This value, epsilon, is a hyperparameter preventing division by 0. It usually has a small value, such as 1e-7, which we'll default to.\n",

    " To implement AdaGrad, we extend our SGD optimizer class; but change the name, add an epsilon property to the object, and remove the momentum.
