# Neural Networks from Scratch... Coded Out

> Learn by doing - Someone, probably? Maybe me.

This is my repo for following along with Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça's *Neural Networks from Scratch*.
I'll be pushing various .ipynb's to this repository incrementally as I work through it. I'll include both my personal notes from my read through + the actual code I do out.
After that, it's off to build cool stuff, all of which will be documented on my site [here](https://www.mattkosze.com).

You can purchase the *Neural Networks from Scratch* book (which I would highly recommend) on their [website](https://nnfs.io)

Hope this is useful somehow!
