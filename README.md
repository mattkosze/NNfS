# Neural Networks from Scratch... Coded Out

> Learn by doing - Someone, probably? Maybe me.

This is my repo for following along with Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça's *Neural Networks from Scratch*.
I'll be pushing to this repository incrementally as I work through it. After that, it's off to build cool stuff, all of which will be documented on my site [here](www.mattkosze.com).

Hope this is useful somehow!

## My Notes

None yet, more coming soon :)
