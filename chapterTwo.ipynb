    "Fundamentally, the output of any singular neuron is determined by three things: inputs, weights, and bias. The inputs are naturally kept the same, but weights and biases change as the model trains. Every neuron will have n weights corresponding to the n incoming connections coming from the previous layer. These are then summed in the neuron and a bias is then added to make the neuron generalize better. Then there's something about activation functions, but we're not there yet.\n",
